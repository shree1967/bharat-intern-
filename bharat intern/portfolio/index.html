                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>Developed a robust sentiment analysis system integrating CNN, LSTM, and VADER. Collected and preprocessed textual data from social media, removing stop words and punctuation for cleaner input. Employed convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for downsampling. Fed the extracted features into an LSTM network to capture long-term dependencies and contextual information. Leveraged VADER to obtain initial sentiment scores, using them as additional features in the CNN LSTM model. Trained the model on labeled sentiment datasets and evaluated its performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>Developed a CAD system for melanoma detection in dermoscopy images, focusing on distinctive lesion border structures. We segmented skin lesions using a novel active contours-based method, utilizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to fit a curve to lesion boundaries. Post-segmentation, the lesion periphery was extracted, and features based on local binary patterns were used for melanoma detection. Validation with PH2 and ISIC datasets showed that our segmentation method closely mimics ground truth data, and significant melanoma characteristics are primarily found at the lesion periphery.</p>

                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p>Developed an image classification model using PointNet, focusing on 3D point cloud data. Implemented feature extraction and classification techniques to accurately categorize objects based on their geometric structures. Validated the model on benchmark datasets, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating the effectiveness of PointNet in handling irregular point sets for robust image classification.Helped to increase the accuracy of the reporting systems by 4%
